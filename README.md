## Project Motivation

### 1. “Uncomfortable” traditional solutions
 - Traditonal solutions(e.g. braille, footpath) are "uncomfortable".
 - Braille is difficult to learn, Footpath is unmanaged...

### 2. Related Works
 - To address the problems with these “traditional solutions,” several wearable devices were proposed.
 - Ask Envision(2024), BeMyEyes(2024), NuEyes(2025) ...
 - However, all of the previous research was focused on solutions for the visually impaired, and there was no platform that resonated with caregivers.
